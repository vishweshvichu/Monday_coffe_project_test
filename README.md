## Objective
The primary aim of this project is to analyze the online sales data of Monday Coffee, a brand that began its digital operations in January 2023. Using this data, we intend to identify and recommend the top three major cities in India that present the best opportunities for establishing new physical coffee shop locations. The recommendation will be based on factors such as consumer demand, revenue performance, customer base, and cost metrics.
## Key Questions
1. **Coffee Consumers Count**  
   What is the estimated number of coffee consumers in each city, assuming that 25% of the city's total population consumes coffee?

2. **Total Revenue from Coffee Sales**  
  What is the overall revenue generated from coffee product sales across all cities during the final quarter (Octoberâ€“December) of 2023?

3. **Sales Count for Each Product**  
   How many units of each individual coffee product have been sold across all cities?

4. **Average Sales Amount per City**  
   What is the average sales amount generated per customer in each city?

5. **City Population and Coffee Consumers**  
   Can we compile a list showing each city's total population along with the estimated number of coffee consumers?

6. **Top Selling Products by City**  
   What are the top three best-selling coffee products in each city based on sales volume?

7. **Customer Segmentation by City**  
  How many unique customers have made coffee purchases in each city?

8. **Average Sale vs Rent**  
   For each city, what are the average sales per customer and the average rent per customer? How do these metrics compare to identify the most financially viable cities?

9. **Monthly Sales Growth**  
   What is the month-over-month percentage growth (or decline) in sales? Calculate and analyze the sales trends across different months to understand overall business momentum and seasonality.

10. **Market Potential Analysis**  
    Identify the top three cities with the highest market potential. For each selected city, provide details including the total sales revenue, total rent costs, total number of unique customers, and the estimated number of coffee consumers.

## Recommendations
After analyzing the data, the recommended top three cities for new store openings are:

**City 1: Pune**  
1. Average rent per customer is very low.  
2. Highest total revenue.  
3. Average sales per customer is also high.

**City 2: Delhi**  
1. Highest estimated coffee consumers at 7.7 million.  
2. Highest total number of customers, which is 68.  
3. Average rent per customer is 330 (still under 500).

**City 3: Jaipur**  
1. Highest number of customers, which is 69.  
2. Average rent per customer is very low at 156.  
3. Average sales per customer is better at 11.6k.
